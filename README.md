# DCC-Marklin-7186-Turntable

A DCC decoder for the Marklin 7186 turntable.

Based on the NMRA example NmraDccAccessoryDecoder_1


The hardware for this is in:

https://github.com/Rosscoetrain/RT-Hardware/tree/master/RT_3_Relay

Which is based on the original work by John Barry here:

This software provides more functionality it programming addresses and allows testing from the serial monitor and control from the serial monitor.

I have not tested this yet (16 July 2023) with my turntable as I'm waiting on electronic components to arrive. Once tested I'll update more details in the hardware repo.
